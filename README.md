# HACKATHON RUNNER

HACKATHON RUNNER is a small platform game built with the game engine
Phaser. Besides the game istelf it has toplists and **real time "ghosts" of other players**. It was built with [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3), [React](https://reactjs.org), [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) and [Redis](https://redislabs.com) for [DigitalOceans App Platform Hackathon on DEV](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k). If you want to try it out yourself you can deploy your own version:

You can read a bit more from the development [here](https://dev.to/awnton/do-hackathon-runner-devlog-1-28pd).

## Running for development

### Dependencies

HACKATHON RUNNER have one required external dependency which is Postgres. It is the database used to store the results for the top lists. To set it up locally you can use any of the methods described [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

> There is also an optional dependency in Redis, but you can [read more below](<#using-redis-(optional)>) if that is relevant.

### Server

To run the server:

1. Create a `.env` file in `/server` and set the environment variables to the values corresponding to your Postgres database:

```text
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=db_user
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=testdb
```

2. Run `npm install` in `/server`
3. Run `npm start` in `/server`

The server should now be served at `localhost:3001`.

### Client

1. Run `npm install` in `/client`
1. Run `npm start` in `/client`

The client should now be served at `localhost:3000`.

### Using Redis (optional)

Redis is used to distribute the messages sent by the server if it's run across multiple nodes (ie to make sure all players are visible to everyone else). This is probably an unneccesary performance optimization if you're just playing around with the game so it's completely optional.

If you do wanna try it out locally you can follow [this guide](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) to install Redis on your own machine.
Then you need to add two more keys to your `.env` file:

```text
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

#### Redis with DigitalOcean

If you want to host it on DigitalOcean with Redis the easiest way is to add a new Redis Database Cluster on [DigitalOcean Cloud](https://cloud.digitalocean.com) and name it `hackathon-runner-db-cluster`. Then use the [`doctl`](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/apis-clis/doctl/) CLI to create (or update) an app with the [app spec](https://github.com/anton-g/hackathon-runner/blob/main/.do/app.yaml). For example:

**Create a new app**:

```text
> doctl apps create --spec .do/spec.yaml
```

**Update an existing app**:

```text
> doctl apps list

ID                 Spec Name         ...
12341234-abcdabcd  hackathon-runner  ...

> doctl apps update 12341234-abcdabcd --spec .do/app.yaml
```

> Remember to change the `repo` fields in the `app.yaml` if you've forked the repo.
