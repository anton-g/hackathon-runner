        HACKATHON RUNNER is a small platform game built with the game engine
        Phaser. It was created for DigitalOceans App Platform Hackathon on DEV (
        <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k">
          link

        ).

        The most technically exciting feature is probably the "ghosts" that you
        see when playing. They are real time representations of every other
        player that is active right now.

        The entire thing is also open source (
        <a href="https://github.com/anton-g/hackathon-runner">link</a>) and some
        of the progress building this is documented on DEV (
